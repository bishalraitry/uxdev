    <p>The tracker tracks many features for the user that can be helpful for the user to manually understand as knowledge as well as being utilised by the LLM for better contextual summarisiation</p>
    <p>It uses GPT-4o-mini in order to create the summary, whilst using many structures and examples during the prompt engineering process such as a template form the financial times own LLM</p>
    <p>It also takes into consideration the various anomalies and only utilises and advises data when sure that there is a high probability that information is backed up and certain from different sources. A lack of which will force the LLM to eitherreject or advise caution.</p>
    <p>As of now the system pulls data using a variety of sources but with most of this done after learning of openbb (openbloomberg) and using it. More apis were used like newsapi and yfinance for more direct information pulling. These pull requests did come with issues in succession rates for actually scraping data with a vague understanding of where the information was actually failing.</p>
    <p>Since Jina.ai was used for the scraping and conversion of sites into text to be taken in as context for LLMs alongside other information soruces the faliure of information points proved to be difficult to catch. Hence why rate limiting pulls  are in place. Further testing needs to be done in order to see if this can be lowered in order to increase pace of the program</p>
